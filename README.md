# Research-Papers
These are the papers I find interesting, mostly focused around the intersection of **security, privacy, and ML**.
I may also list papers relating to the fundamentals of ML/FL infrastructure, or topics involving AI alignment and fairness.

My current focus is the burgeoning field of FL.

This list will be organized by topic and attack model (if applicable).

## Privacy 

### Defenses
- **IBM (Cloud'22)**: DeTrust-FL: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning in Decentralized Trust Setting [`PDF`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07779.pdf)


## Security

### Attacks

>Model Poisoning
- **(ICML'19)**: Analyzing Federated Learning through an Adversarial Lens [`PDF`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12470.pdf) [`Github`](https://github.com/inspire-group/ModelPoisoning)
    - **Attack Model**: "Single, non-colluding malicious agent where the adversarial objective is to cause the model to mis-classify a set of chosen inputs with high confidence." 

### Defenses

>Model Poisoning
- Federated Learning based on Defending Against Data Poisoning Attacks in IoT [`PDF`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06397.pdf)
    - **Attack Model**: "A group of p<n/2 malicious label-flipping poisoning attackers, where n is the total amount of participantsâ€™ clients." 
    
- **(NeurIPS'21)**: FL-WBC: Enhancing Robustness against Model Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning from a Client Perspective [`PDF`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13864.pdf) [`Github`](https://github.com/jeremy313/FL-WBC)
   - **Attack Model**: "Clients mitigate **model poisoning attacks that have already polluted the global model**"
