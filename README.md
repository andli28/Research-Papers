# Research-Papers
Papers I find interesting, mostly focused around the intersection of **security, privacy, and ML**.

My current focus is the burgeoning field of FL.

This list will be organized by topic and attack model.

## Privacy 

### Defenses
- **IBM (Cloud'22)**: DeTrust-FL: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning in Decentralized Trust Setting [`PDF`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07779.pdf)


## Vertical FL (TO READ)
- Vertical Federated Learning: Challenges, Methodologies and Experiments [`PDF`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04309.pdf)
